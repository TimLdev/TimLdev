## Hello, I am Tim! 👋
Programmer & Tutorial-maker on YouTube

#### 🗣️ What I speak & where I live
I live in the Netherlands and I speak Dutch and English fluently.
#### 💻 Programming
I mainly program Minecraft plugins using Java but sometimes I like to make a game in Unity using C#.
#### 🤖 Future
I really enjoy playing and making games, so in the future I definitely want to learn more about game development, but for now I stick with making Minecraft plugins and making tutorials about that.
#### ▶️ YouTube
Like I said I make tutorials on YouTube. The tutorials are in Dutch but in the future I really want to create a English channel where I can help more people. The tutorials are about how to program Minecraft plugins using Java.
